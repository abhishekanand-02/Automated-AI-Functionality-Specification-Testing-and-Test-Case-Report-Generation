# Final QA Report for Login Page

## Functional Specification
The login page enables users to log in to their accounts after registering. The user journey consists of the following steps:
1. Navigate to the homepage (`/`).
2. Click on "Register" to access the registration page (`/accounts/register/`).
3. After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page (`/accounts/login/`).
4. Users log in with their credentials at the login page.
5. Users can access the polls list by clicking "Get Started!" which takes them to `/polls/list/`.

## Test Strategy
The test was conducted using Selenium to automate the login process. The script performs the following actions:
- Navigates to the login page.
- Takes a screenshot before user interaction.
- Inputs valid credentials into the login form.
- Submits the login form and takes another screenshot after submission.
  
## Test Inputs
- Username: `testuser`
- Password: `testpassword`

## Screenshot References
- Before login: `screenshots/before_login.png`
- After login: `screenshots/after_login.png`

## Final Summary/Observations
The test successfully navigated to the login page, entered the provided credentials, and submitted the form. Screenshots were taken before and after the login process to document the state of the application. The functionality of the login page appears to be working as expected based on the test results.
