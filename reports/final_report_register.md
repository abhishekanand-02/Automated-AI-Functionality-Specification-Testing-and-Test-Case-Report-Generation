# Final QA Report for Register Page

## Functional Specification
The `register` page allows users to create a new account. The user interaction flow includes visiting the homepage, clicking on the "Register" link, filling out a registration form, submitting the form, and subsequently logging in to access polls.

**User Interaction Flow**:
1. Visit homepage at `/`.
2. Click "Register" to be redirected to `/accounts/register/`.
3. Submit registration form and get redirected to `/accounts/login/`.
4. Log in using credentials at `/accounts/login/`.
5. Access polls at `/polls/list/`.

## Test Strategy
The test was performed using Selenium, automating the registration process as follows:
1. Navigate to the Registration page (`/accounts/register/`).
2. Fill out the registration form with the provided test inputs.
3. Submit the registration form.
4. Capture screenshots before and after form submission for visual verification.

## Test Inputs
- **Username**: `testuser`
- **Email**: `testuser@example.com`
- **Password**: `securepassword`
- **Confirm Password**: `securepassword`

## Screenshot References
- **Before Registration**: ![Before Registration Screenshot](screenshots/before_register.png)
- **After Registration**: ![After Registration Screenshot](screenshots/after_register.png)

## Summary/Observations
The registration procedure was executed successfully without any errors. Screenshots taken before and after registration implementation confirm the expected page states. The page redirection and form submission processes functioned correctly. Final HTML confirmation and screenshot verification should be reviewed further for any additional concerns. 

Overall, the test indicates that the `register` page is functioning as expected.
